# EmpLoyeeDataReader (UpWork Client Project see ProjectDesciption.pdf File)

Visual Studio Project Details:

I need an application written in Visual Studio using Visual Basic or C#. The application will have 3
buttons (Refresh, Print, and Save), a listbox, and a web browser. It will pull names from a SQL
database and populate those names in the listbox. When the name is selected in the listbox it will
pull the rest of the information associated with that name (date of birth, and other records) fill
into a HTML template and be viewable in the web browser to the right of the listbox. Then the
user can either print or save the file from there.

Database Server:
MS-SQL Server 2012.

1- See DB Folder for Employees DB. To use this DB Please modify App.config file in Visual Studio Project folder and modify connection string that matches your PC settings before running this Project / Application.
